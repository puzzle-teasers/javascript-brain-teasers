// 7 The tilde (~) symbol in JavaScript is known as the bitwise NOT
//operator. It takes the binary representation of a number and flips all the
//bits, resulting in a new number. Now, the thing is, bitwise operators in
//JavaScript work with integers, not floating-point numbers.

const x = ~~(7.9);

console.log(x);
